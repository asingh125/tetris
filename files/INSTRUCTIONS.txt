Welcome to this implementation of Tetris! This game is based on the original version of Tetris, 
but incorporates some features and controls from newer version and includes a few completely 
original features. 

===================
=: How it Works :=
===================
As in original Tetris, pieces fall from the top of the board at a speed of 1 block per second. 
Once a piece collides with the bottom of the board, or another piece stuck to the board, it sticks 
to the board and a new piece appears at the top. Whenever a horizontal line is fully colored, the 
squares in the line disappear and are now empty again. Once the height of stuck pieces reaches the 
top of the board (or a new piece doesn't have room to spawn), the game is over. 

The goal of the game is to create as many full lines as possible before reaching the top and getting
a game over. The player's score corresponds to the number of lines they have created. After the game 
is over, the player is prompted to input their name, and their name and score are recorded in a 
separate file (a default anonymous name will be provided if the user does not give a name). 

The user can shift the piece left and right and rotate the piece clockwise to fit the piece into 
existing holes on the board. They can also hold the down arrow key to make the shape fall faster.
The piece will only move if the movement does not cause a collision with the wall or with another 
square on the board. 

As in newer versions of Tetris, the player can choose to save the current piece for later, or swap 
the current piece on the board with the current saved piece, if they've already saved a piece. 

There are also buttons at the top that allow the player to create a new game, pause the game, or 
view a player's score history, after selecting a user from a dropdown menu of past recorded players.
The current game status is displayed at the very bottom of the board.
